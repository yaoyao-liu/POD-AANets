## POD-AANets

See the original GitHub repository here: <https://git.io/JYHyt>

We are still cleaning up the code for [PODNet](https://github.com/arthurdouillard/incremental_learning.pytorch) w/ AANets. 
<br>
If you need to use it now, here is a preliminary version.
<br>
You need to install the same environment and prepare the same datasets as [PODNet](https://github.com/arthurdouillard/incremental_learning.pytorch) to run this code.

You may run the experiments on ImageNet-Subset using the following command:
```bash
python run_exp.py
```

If you have any questions, please create an issue in [the original repository](https://git.io/JYHyt). Thanks!
